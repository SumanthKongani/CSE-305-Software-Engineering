Over the past century, the world has become accustomed to pollution from vehicles. Lots of carbon monoxide particles being released into the air from vehicles of all kinds have not only polluted our planet heavily but have put future generations at risk. Fortunately, since the turn of the past decade, most of the world is slowly moving towards a cleaner form of energy to use in vehicles, homes, etc. In the automobile industry, electric vehicles have become a major force moving forward towards achieving a net-zero carbon emission goal. Our product combines that goal of a cleaner society with the idea of a car rental service. An Electric Car Rental (ECR) web application is to be developed for people who seek to go to work, rent for a trip, or travel with zero tailpipe emissions, at affordable costs.
